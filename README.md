# LM_Chaboche
Scripts for fitting Chaboche model using the Levenberg-Marquardt method with error analysis

# Overview

This Python script is designed to fit the Chaboche material model to experimental stress-strain data using the Levenberg-Marquardt optimization algorithm. The Chaboche model, a robust constitutive model, is widely used to describe the cyclic behavior and hardening characteristics of materials under plastic deformation.
